## UX 
### The Hike Style's:
The Hike Style’s is a site created for physical activities among nature . That is, where I used much of the design in green color. The green color represents nature, but also represents growth and vitality. The green color is associated with health and tranquility. It is a balanced and rejuvenating color.

### Colour Palette:

## Wireframe mockups
Initially I utilised Balsamiq to produce low fidelity wireframes to organise the site structure, potential content placement locations.

## Features

### Common Features 
* Navigation Bar

  * The navigation bar features a common design across all four pages in keeping with convention with a logo on the left hand size and the navigation links on the right.
  * The navigation bar includes links on the logo, Home, Mission, Photos and Join Us. The various title links head to their respective pages for easy navigation. The logo links back to the homepage as a typical shortcut users will likely be familiar with.
  * A horizontal line appears under the current page as a visual indicator to the user as to which page they are currently on. With a line appearing underneath the text on hover to visually indicate to users that they are clickable.
  * A color is activated once you click on each navigation link. This means that the page you clicked was visited.

* Hero Image

  * Only Home page includes a hero image with a text overlay which further indicates to the user exactly which section of the site they are on.

* Footer
  
  * The lower section of the common footer includes logo links to each of the social media platforms. This provides the user with a visual call to action to prompt them into visiting the organisations social media profiles.
  * These links offer an unintrusive method of promoting the social media channels to the user, providing benefits to the organisation by the way of increased social media following.
  * The lower footer section also includes the copyright notice.

## Testing

The site has been tested by friends in different browsers ( Chorme, Firefox, Safari) and in different smarthphones, laptop and desktop. I have personally tested the site extensively with development tools to ensure that the site works responsively not only on mobile devices, but also on medium to large screens. I realized that in some sizes for browser Safari, the responsiveness was not 100% complete. I fixed this problem along with some internet searches and Slack Comunnity and realized that I was using enough property position. So I studied deeply how to use Flex-Box and manage to solve the problem. 

### Validator Testing
* HTML

  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Validator.

* Lighthouse

  * I generated a lighthouse report for the deployed site through the Google Chrome Dev Tools. I generated both a desktop and mobile report. The two reports, both for mobile and desktop, reported that the image sizes were too heavy to load. I redacted the images and turned them into Webp archive by the site [EZGIF.COM](https://ezgif.com/jpg-to-webp) and then I improved the performance score.
