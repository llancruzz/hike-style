## UX 
### The Hike Style's:
The Hike Style’s is a site created for physical activities among nature . That is, where I used much of the design in green color. The green color represents nature, but also represents growth and vitality. The green color is associated with health and tranquility. It is a balanced and rejuvenating color.

### Color Palette:

## Wireframe mockups
Initially I utilised Balsamiq to produce low fidelity wireframes to organise the site structure, potential content placement locations.

## Features

### Common Features 
* Navigation Bar

  * The navigation bar features a common design across all four pages in keeping with convention with a logo on the left hand size and the navigation links on the right.
  * The navigation bar includes links on the logo, Home, Mission, Photos and Join Us. The various title links head to their respective pages for easy navigation. The logo links back to the homepage as a typical shortcut users will likely be familiar with.
  * A horizontal line appears under the current page as a visual indicator to the user as to which page they are currently on. With a line appearing underneath the text on hover to visually indicate to users that they are clickable.
  * A color is activated once you click on each navigation link. This means that the page you clicked was visited.

* Footer
  
  * The lower section of the common footer includes logo links to each of the social media platforms. This provides the user with a visual call to action to prompt them into visiting the organisations social media profiles.
  * These links offer an unintrusive method of promoting the social media channels to the user, providing benefits to the organisation by the way of increased social media following.
  * The lower footer section also includes the copyright notice.
